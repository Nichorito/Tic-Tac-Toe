# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple web recreation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe.  

Two players will each take a turn placing either an 'X' or an 'O' onto any 
unoccupied square in a 3x3 grid.  

## Winning the game: 

    When one player gets 3 of their symbols in a row (Ex/ Diagonally, Horizontally, 
    or Vertically), they win.  Their score increases by 1.

    If neither player achieves 3 in a row by the time the grid is filled, then 
    it is considered a draw and neither player scores a point.  

    In both scenerios the board is reset to a blank state.

    The first player to reach 3 points is considered the winner.
